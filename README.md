# Group_Project_3_Group2

Our group analysed historical air pollution data for the town of Rainbow lake between January 2022 and August 2023. This was done to ascertain the impact of the Canadian wildfires on the air quality of the region.

We created our own database using SQL lite which we linked to a Python Flask API in order to generate 4 visualisations:

1. Heatmap - showing the change in air quality over time.
2. Bar Chart - showing the monthly average for each individual pollutant.
3. Line Graph - showing the changes in individual pollutant volumes over time.
4. Pie chart - showing the composition of chemicals in the atmospher over time.
